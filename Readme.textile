h3. Traffic Light Netduino project

This is my first Netduino project.
Basically, all it does is simulate a traffic light by changing colors, using 3 LEDs. The code is written in C#, using the MS .Net micro framework and makes use of an LED class and a thread.

Components you'd need for this project:
# A Netduino Plus board
# A mini breadboard
# 3 LEDs colored red, yellow and green
# 7 wires

You can read more about the project in my "blog":http://code.TravelingTechGuy.com/2011/05/1st-netduino-project-traffic-light.html, or watch the "video on youtube":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJYE9ccdrI

The git includes the Fritzing project as well as exported images of the circuit.
